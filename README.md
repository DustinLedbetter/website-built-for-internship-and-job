# website-built-for-internship-and-job

This is a site I built for an internship which continued as a job for several months <br>
til the company shut down do to unforseen circumstances. It was made using different parts that I edited and polished. <br>
The hardest part was creating this site with no help from anyone in the company <br>
as there was no IT department other than myself. It was a start-up truck company and I had to learn everything from scratch.<br><br><br>


//Entire site is uploaded here. It was made using weebly so code is not very clean. But this project is now done and uploaded.
